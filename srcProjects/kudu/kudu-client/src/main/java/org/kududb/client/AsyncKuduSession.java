/**
 * A AsyncKuduSession belongs to a specific AsyncKuduClient, and represents a context in
 * which all read/write data access should take place. Within a session,
 * multiple operations may be accumulated and batched together for better
 * efficiency. Settings like timeouts, priorities, and trace IDs are also set
 * per session.<p>
 *
 * AsyncKuduSession is separate from KuduTable because a given batch or transaction
 * may span multiple tables. This is particularly important in the future when
 * we add ACID support, but even in the context of batching, we may be able to
 * coalesce writes to different tables hosted on the same server into the same
 * RPC.<p>
 *
 * AsyncKuduSession is separate from AsyncKuduClient because, in a multi-threaded
 * application, different threads may need to concurrently execute
 * transactions. Similar to a JDBC "session", transaction boundaries will be
 * delineated on a per-session basis -- in between a "BeginTransaction" and
 * "Commit" call on a given session, all operations will be part of the same
 * transaction. Meanwhile another concurrent Session object can safely run
 * non-transactional work or other transactions without interfering.<p>
 *
 * Therefore, this class is <b>not</b> thread-safe.<p>
 *
 * Additionally, there is a guarantee that writes from different sessions do not
 * get batched together into the same RPCs -- this means that latency-sensitive
 * clients can run through the same AsyncKuduClient object as throughput-oriented
 * clients, perhaps by setting the latency-sensitive session's timeouts low and
 * priorities high. Without the separation of batches, a latency-sensitive
 * single-row insert might get batched along with 10MB worth of inserts from the
 * batch writer, thus delaying the response significantly.<p>
 *
 * Though we currently do not have transactional support, users will be forced
 * to use a AsyncKuduSession to instantiate reads as well as writes.  This will make
 * it more straight-forward to add RW transactions in the future without
 * significant modifications to the API.<p>
 *
 * Timeouts are handled differently depending on the flush mode.
 * With AUTO_FLUSH_SYNC, the timeout is set on each apply()'d operation.
 * With AUTO_FLUSH_BACKGROUND and MANUAL_FLUSH, the timeout is assigned to a whole batch of
 * operations upon flush()'ing. It means that in a situation with a timeout of 500ms and a flush
 * interval of 1000ms, an operation can be oustanding for up to 1500ms before being timed out.
